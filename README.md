# SyntAR
Synthetic data for Aircraft detection and recognition

# Code
## Install dependencies
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Train
To train SinGAN model on your background satellite images, crop the image to get 512 Ã— 512 pixels images . Put the desired training images under Input/Images, and run

`python main_train.py --input_name <input_file_name>`

To run this code on a cpu machine, specify 
`--not_cuda when calling main_train.py`

To harmonize a pasted aircraft into an image (See Fig. 6 in our paper), please first train SinGAN model on the desired background satellite image (as described above), then save the naively pasted reference image and it's binary mask under "Input/Harmonization" (see saved images for an example). Run the command
`python harmonization.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <naively_pasted_reference_image_file_name> --harmonization_start_scale <scale to inject>'

Please note that different injection scale will produce different harmonization effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1.


## User Study

The data used for the user study can be found in the Downloads folder.

backgrounds folder: 5 real images which can serve as backgrounds, randomly picked from the places database
